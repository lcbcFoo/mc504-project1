Professor Michael is a very weird and concerned person. To make sure no one's pen 
would run out of ink in the middle of the test, he made it very clear that every 
student needed two pens to do the test. However, the students forgot, and only 
brought one pen each. Professor Michael got really angry, but made a deal with 
the class: each student still needed to have two pens while writing the answers 
on their test, but they could share the pen with the person on their left or 
their right when the pen was not being used. He, then, placed the desks in a circle, 
so every student would have someone on their left and right.

Possible outcomes

- Regular mode: 
	The students did a really good job sharing the pens and everyone got a 
	chance to answer some questions.

- Starvation mode: 
	One or more students didn't get a chance to pick up two pens at the same 
	time and, therefore, failed the test.

- Deadlock mode: 
	They were not successful in sharing their pens, so no one got two pens at 
	the same time and everyone failed.
